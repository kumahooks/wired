A minimalistic, opionated, keyboard-focused music player for your terminal.

## Why?
Despite my efforts, I've not found a TUI music player exactly how I wanted it to be. So why not do it myself?
The goal is to be extremely simple, minimalistic, lain-themed, and have the following features:
- viewing of song files given a directory
- separation between albums and artists
- visualization of an album or song image
- vim motions
- config as a file first and foremost
- last.fm scrobble support
- personal radio server support
- system agnostic
