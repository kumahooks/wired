# Wire
A minimalistic TUI music player made with Bubbletea.

## The core is under development
I believe these are the points for a minimal working version:
- [X] View for the "Songs" menu
  - [X] Menu View
  - [X] Library View
    - [X] Skeleton of the View
  - [X] Tracks View
  - [X] Footer View
- [ ] View for the "Playlist" menu
- [ ] View for the "Configuration" menu
- [ ] View for the "(?) help" screen
- [X] Dynamic View Size
  - [X] Dynamically resize view on window size
- [ ] Playlist core logic (add, remove, etc)
- [ ] Init screen to set user config
- [ ] Music player core logic (play, pause, next, before, modes (shuffle, sequential)
- [ ] Last.fm scrobbling support
